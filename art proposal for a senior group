Personal Expression Art:
A 5-week Journey in Expressive Art Therapy

Plan:
	Participants will embark on self-discovery and growth by journaling daily in altered books, stepping beyond their comfort zones in artistic mediums. Simultaneously, they will experiment with various art materials such as watercolors, gouache, and acrylic paints, all while being guided to feel empowered rather than overwhelmed by the collaborative painting process.

Objective: 
The objective is to facilitate participants' acclimating to diverse art mediums and expressing their emotions visually. Utilizing altered books as daily visual journals, participants will capture their current emotional state through drawing, akin to photographing their present feelings.

Goal:
Participants will be able to explore their emotions individually through altered book artwork and collaboratively with their group members. The fourth week will feature a collaborative art project, followed by the completion of a canvas artwork in the fifth week. The group will discuss their collective experiences and journey towards achieving their artistic goals. This structured journey aims to foster individual artistic exploration while nurturing collaboration and emotional expression within a supportive group environment.

Week 1:
•	Utilize a whiteboard and markers to express present emotions by creating name boards with simple drawing decorations.
•	Introduce the concept of altered book journals and discuss their benefits in regulating emotions daily using visual journals.
•	Participants will decorate the front covers of their altered books using collages, colored papers, colored tapes, and other materials.
•	Plan for next week: Bring a picture representing a memorable experience.

Week 2:
•	Check-in participants’ feelings and share insights gained from working on altered journal books.
•	Start with dry art mediums such as pencils and markers, and end the session using watercolor pencils with water to express their emotions.
•	Participants use dry art media on a modified book or paper to describe their feelings of memory by referring to the photos they bring.

Week 3:

•	Introduce wet art mediums such as watercolor, gouache, and acrylic to express the feelings of memory in the items brought.
