Self-awareness and coping skills development:
A 5 (or 7-week) Storybook (or Story Puppet Show) Creation Group Therapy

Plan: This group therapy structure is designed to create a safe and supportive environment, fostering self-awareness, emotion regulation, and connection among 4-5 participants aged between 6 and 12. The sessions, held once a week for 50 minutes over five weeks, will use engaging art therapy activities to help participants develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of themselves and their strengths. This will promote greater confidence and resilience. 
Objective: The program aims to facilitate self-expression through art, respecting each participant's boundaries, regardless of diagnosis. Art therapy is a valuable tool for building resilience and coping with emotions. 
Goal: By integrating these activities into the art therapy sessions, participants will enhance their self-confidence and resilience, improving focus, emotional management, and creative expression.

Note: If participants feel hesitant to share positive family moments, they can depict memorable moments from movies or books instead. This program offers a supportive and creative outlet for self-expression. Regardless of diagnosis, self-reflection, caring for others, and expressing gratitude cultivate positive habits, fostering confidence and self-worth through artistic expression. Their puppet show performance will be taped and sent home with a parent consent form, adhering to ethical guidelines prioritizing participants' safety and well-being, including confidentiality, consent, and boundaries.
